RFC Grapher
===========

This is a very small tool I made in an hour or so to graph the dependencies between the RFCs.
It seems like most RFCs link to either many or a very small number.

This repo includes a few things. If the proper deps are available, graphs can be generated by `sh gen.sh ##` with a given RFC number as the final argument.
Additionally, the JSON files can be kept in sync with `sh sync.sh`, and JavaScript can interact with the library by importing the included file.

Dependencies
------------

- `nodejs`: Any recent version should work. Anything with fs/promises.
- `graphviz`: Similarly nothing fancy here.

JS Lib
------

The Javascript library provides the following functions:
- `info`: Read JSON info for a given RFC number in a directory.
- `nodeFrom`: Create a new `Node` for an RFC given a name and the parsed JSON info
- `graphFrom`: Create a graph for a given RFC with a given info directory. Return an object of all nodes.
- `toDot`: Convert a graph to Graphviz DOT format. Highlight any named nodes in the passed array.
- `writeDot`: Write DOT code to a given file.
- `writeDotFor`: Create and write DOT code for a graph of a given RFC, highlighting the original named node.

See the source for more info.
